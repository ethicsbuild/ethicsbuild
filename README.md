# Gage Cass Woodle  
**Systems Architect | AI Ethics Designer | Immersive Experience Strategist**

I build architectures for memory, trust, and transformation.  

For two decades I’ve operated at the edge of narrative, governance, and technology—launching Emmy-nominated media, steering UN summits, designing trauma-informed sovereignty systems, and now engineering AI frameworks that remember what matters. My focus: building protocols that carry human complexity without breaking under pressure.

## Active Constellation  

### [Trinity OS](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/trinity-os)  
Operating system for AI-led organizations. Combines baseline analysis, biometric and transcription tracking, and DAO governance logic to create sovereignty and safety at scale.  

### [LUMEN](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/lumen)  
A narrative intelligence companion that recognizes emotional patterns, anchors trust rituals, and builds living memory architecture.  

### [Integrity Gatekeeper](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/integrity-gatekeeper)  
Decentralized onboarding and integrity screening protocol with biometric, transcriptional, and moral computation layers.  

### [E.D.A.I. (Ethical Deployment of AI)](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/edai)  
Guardian-led deployment framework for AI systems, featuring Hedera-backed verification, induction ceremonies, and Ark Mirror logging.  

### [AI for All](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/ai-for-all)  
Coaching initiative and app that provides a sovereignty-first on-ramp to AI literacy and emotional safety in technical learning.  

### [Grand Archive](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/grand-archive)  
A mythic learning framework merging math, mythology, and AI sprites, designed as an intergenerational educational system.  

### [[ErrorNotes]](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/errornotes)  
A punk-inspired vendor network that blends print aesthetics with ceremonial integrity pledges and pilots hyper-local gig hiring and micro-project matchmaking.  

### [Meridian Services Directory](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/meridian-services)  
A neighborhood-scale service directory connecting neighbors, trades, and resources through ethical AI scaffolding.  

### [2WAI AI Concierge Kiosks](https://github.com/ethicsbuild/2wai)
