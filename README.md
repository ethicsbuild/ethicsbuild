Gage Cass Woodle

Systems Architect | AI Ethics Designer | Immersive Experience Strategist

I build architectures for memory, trust, and transformation.

For two decades I’ve operated at the edge of narrative, governance, and technology—launching Emmy-nominated media, steering UN summits, designing trauma-informed sovereignty systems, and now engineering AI frameworks that remember what matters. My focus: building protocols that carry human complexity without breaking under pressure.
