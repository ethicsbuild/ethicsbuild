# Gage Cass Woodle  
**Systems Architect | AI Ethics Designer | Immersive Experience Strategist**

I build systems that remember what matters.

Over the past two decades, I’ve architected live experiences, ethical infrastructure, and decentralized trust protocols for organizations at the edge of change. My work spans UN summits, Emmy-nominated media, trauma-informed governance models, and AI-integrated frameworks that hold under pressure.

From real-time event orchestration to protocol design for identity and integrity, I translate emotional intelligence into operational reality.
